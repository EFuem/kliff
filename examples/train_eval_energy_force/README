To train ANN using a graph with data processing Queues, and write checkpoints for
later evaluation of validation error using another graph.

You need to modify the dataset path.

To fit and validate energy,
$ python train_ann_energy.py
$ python eval_ann_energy.py

To fit and validate forces,
$ python train_ann_force.py
$ python eval_ann_force.py
