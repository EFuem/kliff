## Summary

Include a summary of major changes in bullet points:

* Feature 1
* Fix 1

## Additional dependencies introduced (if any)

* List all new dependencies needed and justify why. While adding dependencies that bring
  significantly useful functionality is perfectly fine, adding ones that add trivial
  functionality, e.g., to use one single easily implementable function, is frowned upon.
  Provide a justification why that dependency is needed. Especially frowned upon are
  circular dependencies.

## TODO (if any)

If this is a work-in-progress, write something about what else needs to be done.

* Feature 1 supports A, but not B.
